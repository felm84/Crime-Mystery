# Henry comments 13/April: 
- JSON data is looking interesting. I'm curious how you'll make conversations work from here (note that if you find one format doesn't work or isn't convenient enough going forward, refactor as necessary).
- Your sherlock images isn't listed in license.txt

# Felipe comments 13/April:
 - More JSON data mock for speeches will be added this week. Conversation mechanism is fixed, tested and working now, it will receive more options, both player and npc.
 - Images will also be added in license.txt
